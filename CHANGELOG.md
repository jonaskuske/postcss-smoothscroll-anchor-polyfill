## [2.0.2] - 2022-11-30

- Don't add a `font-family` for `scroll-behavior: inherit` if element has no own font rule to take advantage of font inheritance.

## [2.0.1] - 2019-06-12

### Fixed

- Added `smoothscroll-anchor-polyfill@^1.3.0` as `peerDependency` instead of just mentioning it in the changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2019-06-11

### Added

- The plugin now supports [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) to polyfill only what's needed! If your project has a browserslist config and all browsers specified there support CSS Custom Property, the PostCSS transform will use a CSS variable instead of the `font-family` workaround. ðŸ’¡
